Basics
======

Concepts
--------

Each new sandboxed environment is referred to as a *dram*.

The environment variable ``DRAM_ROOT`` is the root directory where all drams
are kept. Each dram is a subdirectory.

.. warning::

    Root privileges should generally not be necessary to install anything into
    a dram. Avoid the temptation to use ``sudo``. You may wish to consider
    changing the ownership of your ``/usr/local`` directory to root in order to
    prevent any dram usage from "spilling" into the global environment.

Dram Types
----------

* **Plain** drams are intended for installing most open source "directly", via
  a ``./configure`` script or similar mechanism. They are not populated with
  any initial files or directories, but set up environment variables that will 

* **Plain-with-python** drams are the same as Plain drams with the addition of
  an integrated python virtual environment for the dram.

* **Homebrew** drams populate an instance of `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_.

* **Macports** drams populate an instance of `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`_.

Command-Line Usage
------------------

Dram includes a command-line utility which is the expected entry point for most
usage. Some examples are below. You can also see the utility itself for more
info::

    $ dram help

Creating a New Dram
-------------------

This will create a new dram you can then install stuff into.::

    $ dram create example

To create a dram of a particular type::

    $ dram create -t macports example

When creating a dram of type ``plain-with-python`` you can also pass the
``-p`` and ``--system-site-packages`` flags and they will be passed through
to the virtual environement when it is created for that dram.

Using The Dram
--------------

Creating a dram automatically switches to it, but if you want to switch to an already created dram::

    $ dram use example

Note that if you have set the ``DRAM_AUTO_CDSOURCE`` environment variable, then dram will automatically 
switch to the source directory of the activated dram whenever you do ``dram use <dram name>``

Dram includes wrappers around common build tools (autotools and cmake) to ease installing software into the dram.

Installing Software with CMake
------------------------------

As an example, let's install `libftdi` from a source tarball.

First move into the `source` subdirectory, by convention::

    $ dram cdsource

Download and extract the package here::

    $ curl -O https://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download/libftdi1-1.5.tar.bz2
    $ tar -xvf libftdi1-1.5.tar.bz2
    $ cd libftdi1-1.5

Invoke CMake using the dram wrapper::

    $ dram cmake ..

Install normally, which will install into this dram's directory structure::

    $ make && make install

Install Software with Autotools
-------------------------------

Install autotools-based software is similar. Here is a typical installation of `liquid-sdr`::

    $ dram cdsource
    $ git clone https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp.git
    $ cd liquid-dsp
    $ ./bootstrap.sh
    $ dram configure
    $ make && make install

Listing Drams
-------------

List all the current drams in your root::

    $ dram list

If the ``-l`` flag is passed to ``dram list``, then the size of each dram on disk will be printed as well.

Destroying a Dram
-----------------

Wipe out any traces of a current dram::

    $ dram destroy example
